**v1.0**
Initial Release for OmegaWeapons!


***Main Weapons***

**Pistol**
Damage increased, 4.64 -> 5.26 (Given the pistol has less ammo than the HAR, this change is put in place to make it better match the HAR’s total damage profile.)

**Burst Pistol**
Damage increased, 3.2(6.4) -> 3.76(7.52)
Max Ammo decreased, 283 -> 252 (cost 1.8 -> 1.92)

**HEL Revolver**
Magazine Size decreased, 8 -> 6 (Made to better reflect the 6 chamber cylinder of the revolver, reload speed increased to compensate.)
Reload Speed increased, 2.3s -> 2.0s
Max ammo reduced, 100 -> 90 (cost 5.0 -> 5.5)

**Machine Pistol**
Damage increased, 1.9 -> 2.26
Falloff range decreased, 7-35m -> 4-32m (Better general breakpoints at the cost of lower range, to not be redundant with SMG.)

**HEL Autopistol**
No changes, very well balanced weapon after the last balance patches

**Bullpup Rifle**
Merged with Assault Rifle, new name **Assault Bullpup**. This rework was put in place to consolodate the amount of auto weapons, and to give a longer range automatic option.
Reload Speed reduced, 2.5s -> 2.9s
Reload Cancel fixed
Fire Rate reduced, 1090RPM -> 937.5RPM
Damage increased, 2.1 -> 3.01 
Recoil reduced by about 10-15%
Stagger Multiplier reduced, 1x -> 0.7x
Less max ammo, 346 -> 270 (cost 1.5 -> 2)

**SMG**
SMG:
Renamed to **Precision SMG**, the replacement of midrange auto weapon after the merging of assault rifle and bullpup.
Recoil reduced mildly
Falloff Distance increased, 6-55m -> 8-64m
Damage very slightly increased, 1.98 -> 2.1
Precision damage increased, 0.91x -> 1.0x
Reload speed reduced, 1.4s -> 1.75s
Flashlight Changed to Medium Range #2

**PDW**
Damage increased, 2.15 -> 2.41
Precision Multiplier increased, 0.7413 -> 0.833x
(Basically the same as tru’s Vanilla Reloaded but shifted ever so slightly to damage for marginally and possibly insignificant breakpoints.)

**Heavy SMG**
Damage increased, 2.45 -> 2.71 (Allows for an extremely slightly faster ttk on most enemies, and makes it the premier automatic DPS weapon vs chargers.)
Stagger Multiplier increased, 1.0x -> 1.2x
Max Ammo lowered slightly, 339 -> 313 (cost 1.5 -> 1.64)
Flashlight changed to Medium Range #1

**Carbine**
Reload Speed reduced, 1.6s -> 2.2s (Its reload was a bit unreasonably fast.)
Falloff distance reduced, 10-65 -> 6-60
Total max ammo increased, 378 -> 400 (cost 1.4 -> 1.3)

**DMR**
Damage Increased, 7.51 -> 8.01 (1-tap strikers to the head, I personally found it disappointing that a DMR couldnt 1shot the most common enemy.)
Magazine Size decreased 12 -> 10 (Mag size reduced to compensate for the 1-shot power.)

**Double Tap Rifle**
Max Ammo increased, 135 -> 154 (cost 3.8 -> 3.285) (Better competes with the newly buffled DMR's ammo efficiency.)

**Assault Rifle**
Removed, merged with Bullpup Rifle above

**Rifle**
Damage increased, 5.08 -> 6.12 (Better threshold for chargers, 2 shot shooters.)
Max ammo decreased, 135 -> 119 (cost 3.8 -> 4.01)

**Sawed-Off Shotgun**
Magazine Size decreased, 4 -> 3 (It’s a triple action, not a quad.)
Reload Speed increased, 1.6s -> 1.4s
Spread and cone size increased, 2 -> 3
Stagger Multiplier Reduced, 2x -> 1.5x
(Basically ripped straight from Vanilla Reloaded, but with a bit of bonus reload speed because i didn't personally like the reload speed in VR.)

**HEL Shotgun**
Magazine Size reduced, 14 -> 11 (Mildly lowering the sustained damage and crowd control output so you can't single-handedly shut down surge waves.)

**Slug Shotgun**
Damage Increased, 21 -> 27 (Better staggering, precision damage = 20)
Fire rate increased, 80 -> 93.75 RPM
Mag Size increased, 6 -> 8
Max Ammo increased, 44 -> 52 (cost 12 -> 10.4)
(The slug shotgun has always felt fun to use, but very underpowered compared to the rest of the shotguns in the game, this may be an overbuff though.)


***Special Weapons***

**Heavy Assault Rifle**
Max Ammo increased slightly, 149 -> 165 (cost 1.92 -> 1.7)
Recoil decreased by about 30%

**Short Rifle**
Reworked considerably to closer reflect the weapon's namesake, very increased close range damage effectiveness but falls off at mid-long range where DMR and PR shine.
Ammo Max reduced, 196 -> 75 (cost 1.38 -> 3.83)
Magazine Size reduced, 30 -> 15
Damage increased, 4.81 -> 11.11
Precision multiplier reduced, 0.7413x -> 0.6x
Stagger multiplier increased, 0.5x ->1x
Fire rate reduced, 1500 -> 300 RPM
Reload Speed reduced, 1.7 -> 2.3
Falloff Distance reduced, 8-58m -> 5-45m

**Burst Rifle**
Changed to special weapon because trying to balance this alongside carbine, DMR, burst pistol and rifle was a massive pain in the ass.
Burst Fire rate decreased, 1500 -> 857.12
Burst Delay increased, 0.15 -> 0.2
Magazine Size increased, 30 -> 36
Damage increased, 2.71 (8.13 burst) -> 2.92 (8.76 burst)
Max Ammo reworked for special, 308 -> 183 (cost 1.65 -> 1.5)

**Shotgun**
Falloff Distance increased, 4m-40m -> 7m-42m
Reserve ammo increased, 24 -> 28 (Ammo Cost 9.55 -> 8.21)
(This weapons ammo and falloff always felt a bit underwhelming, so they've been tuned up a bit)

**Combat Shotgun**
Changed to **Defender Shotgun**, taking away a notable chunk of its DPS capabilities and making it a sidegrade to hel shotgun.
Magazine size increased, 12 -> 15
Damage decreased, pellets increased, 15.06 (2.51 x 6) -> 9.92 (1.24 x 8)
Max Ammo increased, 69 -> 87 (Cost 4 -> 3.19)
Stagger Multiplier increased, 2x -> 2.4x
Fire rate increased, 240 -> 270 RPM

**Scattergun**
Changed to **Hydra Scattergun**, the scattergun has always dealt a problematic amount of burst damage, so I took the weapon's "drei" name, and reworked it around that.
Magazine size increased, 2 -> 3
Damage massively reduced, 153.6 (4.8x32) -> 70.4 (2.2x32)
Ammo Max increased, 16 (14 + 2 mag) -> 21 (18 + 3 mag)
Reload Speed decreased, 2.66 -> 3.6
Falloff worsened, 4-30m -> 4-24m
Fire rate decreased, 92rpm -> 81rpm
Flashlight changed to Short Range Flashlight

**Choke Mod Shotgun**
Changed to 2 Burst for experimental purposes, it was already a burst weapon in the code.
Reload Cancel Improved
Max Ammo increased slightly, 27 -> 30 (cost 10 -> 8.85)
Minimum recoil reduced by 25%, Max unchanged
Burst Fire rate reduced 1500 -> 800 RPM
Burst Delay, 0.3s

**Revolver**
Damage increased, 14.21 -> 17.01
Precision Multiplier increased, 0.7413x -> 0.8x
Max Ammo decreased, 52 -> 45 (cost 4.9 -> 5.9)
(Made to compete with the hel gun in the same slot, doing better against flyers, big flyers and hybrids, but worse against charger hordes.)

**Arbalist Machinegun**
Renamed to **HEL Machinegun**, made to be a viable option against nightmare hordes due to the increased precision multiplier and penetration.
Precision Multiplier increased, 0.7413 -> 0.8333x
Pierce added, 1
Recoil reduced by about ~25-30% (being a heavier machine gun than the veruta, it should have significantly lower recoil.) 
Max ammo reduced, 184 -> 160 (cost 1.595 -> 1.92)

**Veruta Machinegun**
Recoil reduced by ~10%
Damage Increased, 3.51 -> 3.76
Max Ammo increased, 260 -> 300 (bullet cost 1.15 -> 0.958)
Reload Cancel slowed
(Inversely to the Arbalist, this weapon was improved against charger hordes, made to make both of them enticing for later game levels.)

**Burst Cannon**
Magazine Size decreased, 20 -> 18 so that the 3 burst divides evenly
Max ammo unchanged, 66 -> 66 (due to mag change, bullet cost 5.0 -> 4.79)

**HEL Gun**
Magazine Size reduced, 9 -> 8
Max Ammo Reduced, 49 -> 42 (cost 5.74 -> 6.76)
(May be an overnerf of ammo, but made to rein in its sheer ammo efficiency in group horde enviornments.)

**High Caliber Pistol**
Max Ammo Increased, 31 -> 36 (ammo cost 9 -> 7.67)

**Precison Rifle**
Precision Multiplier increased, 1.3x -> 1.43x
(I felt like Vanilla Reloaded massively overstepped in rebalancing this weapon, PM increased to hit better thresholds against everything suceptible to it.)

**Sniper**
Magazine Size increased, 2 -> 3
Reload Speed reduced, 3.5s -> 4.0s
(I think the sniper needs a 3 mag like most other mods, but I never agreed with increasing its reload speed as well.)

**HEL Rifle**
Max Ammo reduced, 28 -> 25 (cost 10 -> 11.5)
Peirce reduced, 5 -> 3
(Extremely ammo efficient weapon, toned down a bit to hopefully reign things in a bit but ensure it still being a very attractive option. May need to nerf more.)


***Melee Weapons***

**Sledgehammer**
Unchanged, despite being overly safe as an option, i believe it still has weaknesses that ensure its omnipresence isn't a result of overtuning.

**Knife**
Unchanged, its power level appropriately rewards skilled play while not being too overpowered at anything, still has notable weaknesses to keep it in check.

**Spear**
Charged 25% Speed Penalty removed
Light Damage 2 -> 2.5
Light Precision Multiplier reduced, 1.3 -> 1.1x
Charge time 1.8s -> 1.5s
Charge/Shove Drain  5% -> 3%
(I mostly agreed with tru's Vanilla Reloaded here, but I felt the movement speed penalty being kept was not ideal, so i reduced the power of precision light attacks and stamina drain.)

**Bat**
Charged Damage 12 -> 13 
Light Damage 3 -> 4, 
Light stagger 5x -> 4x 
Light Precision Multiplier 1x -> 0.8x
(Again, agreed with Vanilla Reloaded for the most part, but didnt want striker 1taps to the occiput, instead 1 back charged hit + 1 tap kill on chargers.)


***Tools***

**Burst Sentry**
Unchanged, i felt Vanilla Reloaded's changes were too minor to really matter, and it does have downsides against giants and surges, so I feel it's in a good spot.

**Sniper Sentry**
Maximum ammo increased, 32 -> 35 (cost 16.0 -> 15.0)
Shot delay icreased, 2.6 -> 2.8
Start fire delay lowered, 2.8 -> 2.0
Bio-symbiosis start fire delay multiplier increased, 0.5 -> 0.7
(Identical to Vanilla reloaded, I think they got it just right.)

**HEL Auto Sentry**
Maximum ammo increased, 751 -> 955 (cost 0.7 -> 0.55)
Shot delay increased, 0.08 -> 0.1
Start fire delay reduced, 1.0 -> 0.75
(Nearly identical to Vanilla Reloaded, I just felt like it was a bit too efficient when placed directly next to a team actively firing alongside it, but increased its responsiveness.)

**Shotgun Sentry**
Damage total increased, 15.05 -> 30.1 (Pellet count increased 5 -> 10, damage unchanged from 3.01)
Shot delay increased, 0.75 -> 1.0
Start fire delay reduced, 0.5 -> 0.3
Rotation speed massively increased, 8.0 -> 20.0
Detection max range reduced, 10 -> 8
Detection max angle increased, 40 -> 50
Changed targeting to fire towards the body of enemies rather than their head
Bio-symbiosis start fire delay multiplier increased, 0.25 -> 0.75
Bio-symbiosis rotation speed multiplier reduced, 2.0 -> 1.0
Bio-symbiosis bullet cost multiplier increased, 0.5 -> 1.0
Bio-symbiosis shot delay multiplier increased, 0.6 -> 0.75
(Similar to Vanilla Reloaded, but adjusted towards more damage and overall slower firing speed, and not increasing the accuracy or changing the ammo, making it more efficient for chargers and nightmares overall.)
