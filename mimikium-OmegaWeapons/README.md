GTFO Weapon Rebalance by Mimikium

This balance mod is a product of not being fully satisfied by any vanilla rebalance patch I have run into during my time in the community, but shoutouts to Tru’s Vanilla Reloaded for being the one I’ve enjoyed the most! A couple of my changes are inspired by or taken from that mod, though most will be my own or my friend’s view of how we want to approach weapon balance.

This mod is strictly balanced around Vanilla's difficulty level, and any rundowns that are within the realms of that, including my own modded rundown that I am currently working on at the time of writing this. This is not intended to be used for vanilla progression or for hard mods like Samdown, Legacy, Quixotic, etc.
